<p>In The Sims 2, an alarm system will cover the entire space it is put in. Burglar alarms can not be placed outdoors, unless the moveobjects cheat is used. Each room with a door to the outdoors should have an alarm. If cheats are used to place a burglar alarm outdoors, it will cover the whole outside area, obstructed just by outdoor fences.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face alerts, which can determine individuals the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to identify those individuals and will send mobile phone alerts with that info when they show up at your home. We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to want to identify predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) likewise provide a broader variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
