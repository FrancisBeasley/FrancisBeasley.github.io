The clever bit is that the camera not just spots that people have actually entered its 130-degree field of vision, but it will also have a stab at acknowledging them too.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and then integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely typical because the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, once customers recognize that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's typically too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>

If your system equipment consists of an audible alarm, the noise may scare off prospective trespassers-- if you're fortunate. But the police will not come until you personally call them. </p>
