So I still have 21 months of a contract I had no concept I remained in, to get out I have to pay $783.  Actually frustrating. Once again the sales individuals, or at least mine, do not discuss the 3 year dedication. I called their customer care group and they acknowledged that the sales people do not need to mention it, it's on you to check out the small print. I'm paying the lump amount, since obviously they car renew you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send out in a written not by mail.  ADT is a nightmare, way too costly, and not fantastic.</p>

<p>Another area where Arlo excels is customer support.

<p>Security: There have actually been lots of headlines about hackers compromising home cameras, child screens, and other Wi-Fi devices to spy on individuals, so be sure to inspect what steps has each producer taken to eliminate this problem.
