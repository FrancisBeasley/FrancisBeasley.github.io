<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can identify individuals the camera is spotting using face acknowledgment. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to determine those people and will send out smart device informs with that information when they show up at your home. We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to want to distinguish anticipated visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to determine faces on a close-by TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) likewise provide a larger variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
