<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face alerts, which can identify people the camera is identifying utilizing face acknowledgment. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to determine those people and will send mobile phone notifies with that info when they appear at your home. We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to want to identify anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the function to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also supply a wider series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
