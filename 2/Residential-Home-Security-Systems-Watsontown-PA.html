<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that compare individuals and basic motion. We think that's expensive.</p>
<p>And we plan to look at a number of budget cameras (under $100), including the Hoop Webcam, the Hoop Camera Plus, the Blink Mini, the Kangaroo Privacy Camera, the Eufy Indoor Web Cam 2K, and the Eufy Indoor Web Cam 2K Pan & Tilt The Eufy cameras include a 2K image, with the rest delivering 1080p.
