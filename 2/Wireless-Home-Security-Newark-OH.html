<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, most burglar alarms work the exact same way. They use open and closed circuits to transfer an electrical current. When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which suggests if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if somebody were to open the door that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be transferred. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, unlocking permits the electrical existing to stream throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the alarm system will activate.</p>
