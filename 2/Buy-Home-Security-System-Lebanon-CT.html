When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. If the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits, which means. If someone were to open the door that would imply that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then set off the burglar alarm. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door enables the electrical existing to stream throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will activate.</p>
