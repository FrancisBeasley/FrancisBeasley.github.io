<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational information to a destructive attacker, since the disruption of the network avoids the flow of data and actually indirectly protects information by avoiding it from being sent. The normal factor for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, during which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all gadgets, offering an opportunity for the harmful enemy to record these codes and use numerous splitting tools to examine security weaknesses and exploit them to gain unauthorized access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools available which can release a dictionary style attack of "perhaps accepted" security keys based upon the "model" security key captured during the network healing.</p>
