<p>I described that all we would require to do is tap into any among the emergency situation call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also included two-way audio, and that camera would become the user interface into the VMS system. When a client presses the emergency situation button, it sends out dual informs: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Additionally, if the central patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the risk and, if required, could merely press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular floor.</p>
