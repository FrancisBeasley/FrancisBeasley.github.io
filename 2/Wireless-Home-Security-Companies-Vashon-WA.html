<p>Alarm systems have ended up being basic equipment in shops and other businesses, and they're ending up being progressively typical in private homes too. When it concerns the EZVIZ Complete HD Indoor Smart Security Camera in our best security camera round-up, the pros far outweigh the cons: it has a strong 1080p video feed, night vision, a decent 135-degree field of vision, two-way audio and a straightforward app. Aside from the name, ADT also has a large range of security equipment to protect your home.
