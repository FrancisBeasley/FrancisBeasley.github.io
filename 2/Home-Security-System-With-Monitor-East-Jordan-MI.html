<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that compare people and general motion. We believe that's pricey.</p>
