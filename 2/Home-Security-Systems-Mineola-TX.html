<p>Firstly, it's difficult to dislike the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other choices, however it's better than a lot of cameras that are four times the rate. The field of view is a narrow 110 degrees (compared with 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). However, after practically two years of night, day and use images have actually constantly been clear, and we never had issues with the camera missing motion, a problem we encountered when evaluating the Wyze Webcam Pan And for those times when you're left wondering why your camera sent out a motion alert, Wyze has a clever function you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It produces a green, on-screen box around the motion identified.

<p>A tight wire border security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to identify any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensors to neglect things that exert percentages of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is susceptible to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
