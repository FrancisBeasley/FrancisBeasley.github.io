When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name.

We also found the function to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) likewise provide a broader range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
