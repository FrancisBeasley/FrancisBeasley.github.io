<p>Your CCTV camera may make you feel physically more secure, but after reading this post, it will sure make you feel essentially susceptible. A couple of minutes into the DIY installation, our tester got stuck getting her control board up and online-- it just would not connect. An aid window turned up with a number to call, and a Frontpoint rep helped her troubleshoot the connection. After about 10 minutes, he could inform there was an issue with the circuit board. Certainly not perfect-- however the rep asked forgiveness and shipped her replacement control board over night.</p>
