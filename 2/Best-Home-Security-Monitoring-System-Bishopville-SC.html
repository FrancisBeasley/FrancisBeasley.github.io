<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents talking with somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered.

If a property owner forgets their secrets and returns inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is set off by an area cat, it can trigger the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the property owner will be called by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it quickly. False alarms occur. With a self-monitored system, a property owner will not receive calls from a monitoring company. Rather, house owners access the alarm themselves and take the required action.</p>
