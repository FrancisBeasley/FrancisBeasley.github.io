<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to discover any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires.
