<h2>Custom Security Systems Kasson</h2>

<p>The Nest Cam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were impressive in our testing-- during the day and at night-- with a large, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video. We ought to keep in mind that the camera would sometimes downgrade the picture quality based on available bandwidth, which might vary throughout the day.
