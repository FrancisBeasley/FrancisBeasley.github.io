We likewise found the feature to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to identify faces on a close-by TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also supply a larger series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
