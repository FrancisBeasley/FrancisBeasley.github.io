A fine example is the Vivint system, which we've evaluated individually and do not recommend for many people.</p>

<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face signals, which can determine people the camera is spotting using face recognition. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those people and will send smartphone alerts with that info when they show up at your home. We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to differentiate predicted visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the function to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to identify faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also provide a wider series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
