<p>The Nest IQ is a seriously impressive piece of innovation. For starters, it looks gorgeous: the all-white design and black camera face are seriously spacey (if eerily reminiscent of the AI in 2001: A Space Odyssey). When you imagine a home security camera, it's far from the ghastly metal CCTV box that you may call to mind.
