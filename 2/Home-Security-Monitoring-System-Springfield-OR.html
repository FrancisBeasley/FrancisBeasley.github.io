<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to detect any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensors to disregard things that put in percentages of pressure on the wires.
