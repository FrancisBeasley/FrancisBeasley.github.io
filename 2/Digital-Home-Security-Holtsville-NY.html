<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face alerts, which can recognize individuals the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name.

Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also offer a broader variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
