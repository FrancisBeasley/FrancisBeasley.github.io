<p>After evaluating lots of wired and wireless choices, the best home security camera for the majority of people is the Arlo Pro 2.

Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint does not have an agreement, and its equipment pricing is very reasonable, so it's not a total splurge. However you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the likes of Vivint or Brinks.</p>
