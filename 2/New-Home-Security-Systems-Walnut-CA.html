<p>A taut wire border security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to spot any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensing units to ignore things that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
