<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely typical considering that the entrance and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when consumers recognize that the economical consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's typically far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
