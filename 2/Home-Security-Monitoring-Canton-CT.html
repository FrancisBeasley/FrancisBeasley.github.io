Some systems can be set up to permit deactivation of specific sensing units or groups.  High-end systems allow numerous access codes, and may even allow them to be used only once, or on particular days, or just in combination with other users' codes (i.e., accompanied). In any case, a remote monitoring center must organize an oral code to be offered by an authorized individual in case of false alarms, so the monitoring center can be guaranteed that a further alarm response is unnecessary.
