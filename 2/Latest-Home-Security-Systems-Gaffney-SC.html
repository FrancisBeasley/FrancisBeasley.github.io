<p>The arguments for and against CCTV cameras below are purely examples of comments that have been discussed, and are not designed to duplicate views from IFSEC Worldwide and its group. Following behind the Ultra 4K is the brand new Arlo Pro 3, which delivers a comparable package but with 2K video instead. When shopping for a new security camera system, it's a great overall system (specifically with several cameras) and must absolutely be weighed up alongside the Ultra.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great however good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
