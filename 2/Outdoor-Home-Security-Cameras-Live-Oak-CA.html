We first discovered Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E But once we attempted it out, it rapidly became a staff (and family and friends) fave. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a sound maker. It can't send signals, you can't manage it from another location, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
