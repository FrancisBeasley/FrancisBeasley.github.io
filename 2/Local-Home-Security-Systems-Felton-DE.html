<p>The Blink XT2 is small, operates on two AA batteries, and includes a year's worth of complimentary cloud storage, and it records a better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a choice? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, mobile phone notifications and live views were painfully slow, and the range is poor. Also, if the camera is in the middle of recording, don't expect to get a live peek or make any settings changes-- it can't multitask.</p>

It has a close-up tracking feature, which instantly focuses on motion and then follows it around the field of view.

It can distinguish between basic motion and individuals, so it cuts down on false alarms, and it can even determine people you've labeled (after a learning period).
