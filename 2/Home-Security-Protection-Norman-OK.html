So I still have 21 months of an agreement I had no idea I was in, to get out I need to pay $783.  Really frustrating. Once again the sales people, or a minimum of mine, do not point out the 3 year dedication. I called their client service team and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not have to discuss it, it's on you to check out the fine print. I'm paying the swelling amount, since apparently they auto restore you at some time unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send out in a written not by mail.
