<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely typical given that the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once customers realize that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late given that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>

It costs a lot, its prices isn't always transparent, and it still has long contracts. Not to point out that the customer care experience differs commonly depending on the dealer you opt for. </p>
