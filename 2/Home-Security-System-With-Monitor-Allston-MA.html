I have actually dumped my Nest Cams given that they were purchased by Google. Something all of us require to think about. Sirens. So your camera has actually discovered burglars or wild animals.

Which, you imagine, would be enough to send even the most committed career criminal scampering empty-handed down the road. </p>
