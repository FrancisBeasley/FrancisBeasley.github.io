<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky.

Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, however outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>
