The greatest image quality of DVD is only slightly lower than the quality of basic 5:1- compression DV.</p>

<p>Monitored security systems are systems that are actively monitored by an expert home security company. When the system spots a burglary, fire, or other emergency situation, it informs the security group and, in many cases, emergency responders.
