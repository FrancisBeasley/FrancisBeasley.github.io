<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it offers protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software application to find it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just a false sense of security given that it prevents only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
