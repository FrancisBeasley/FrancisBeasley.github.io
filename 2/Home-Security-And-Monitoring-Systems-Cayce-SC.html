<p>Last, we also think about how much it costs to view, save and share recorded video.

If you have large animals, you may want to consider skipping the motion sensing units and rely more on the window and door sensors which aren't activated by motion but are activated when a window or door is opened.</p>
<p>Since it's more complex than it should be, we don't suggest the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, informs, and integration all require separate IFTTT-style guidelines.
