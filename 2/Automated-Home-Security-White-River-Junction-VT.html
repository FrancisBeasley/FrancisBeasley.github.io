<p>Recently, Ring rejected reports that it had suffered a data breach, however we concur with its suggestion that users should reset passwords and allow two-factor authentication as a preventive procedure. All smart-home devices are susceptible to such events. Nevertheless, after this most current entry in a year-long series of controversial media reports, we have chosen to pull our recommendation of Ring's video doorbells. If you plan to match the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first check out the What about Ring? area from our clever video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it pertains to video products, we don't believe that these concerns modify the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay confident in our present suggestion.</p>
