<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the severe environment.</p>
