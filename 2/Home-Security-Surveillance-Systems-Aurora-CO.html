<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally typical considering that the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once customers understand that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late considering that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
