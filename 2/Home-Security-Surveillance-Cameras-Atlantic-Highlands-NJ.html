<h3>Local Home Security Monitoring in New Jersey</h3>
<p>Ring may not be the most advanced system on our list (Vivint takes that reward), but it sure has actually gained quite the fanfare for many years. We have actually been checking Ring Alarm a fair bit recently, and we in fact like the system for what it is. So what is it? Well, it's a prepackaged security package that uses basic intrusion protection with super-low regular monthly monitoring fees. Or ... no monitoring charges at all if you pick the totally free self-monitor" option.</p>

Many websites requiring alarm installations no longer have standard telephone lines (POTS), and alarm panels with standard telephone dialer ability do not work dependably over some kinds of VoIP service.</p>

Clients can choose anything from standard monitoring to full-on home security automation, with the best combination of services and gadgets to fit their needs. </p>
