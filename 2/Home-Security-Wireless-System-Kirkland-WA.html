<p>One vital exception: ADT has a landline monitoring plan that's $36.99 each month, which might be an inexpensive alternative for consumers in rural areas.

<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear video in dark conditions.

The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see during the night. If catching video footage in the dark is a top priority, make certain your camera has lots of IR LEDs.</p>
