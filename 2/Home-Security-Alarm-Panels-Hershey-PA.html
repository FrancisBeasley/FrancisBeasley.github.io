The recorder has 2 jobs- recording the caught video and being a standalone wifi network.

Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are saved for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly fee (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limits, we often discovered action missing out on, thanks to irregular and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
