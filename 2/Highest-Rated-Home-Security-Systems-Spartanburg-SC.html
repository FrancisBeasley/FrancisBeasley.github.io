<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the harsh environment.</p>

And Activity Zones are a good perk, especially if you're aiming to monitor a particular corner of the yard, an entrance, and even trash bin. </p>
