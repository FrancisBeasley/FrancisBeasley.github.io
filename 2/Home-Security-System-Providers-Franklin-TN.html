<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face notifies, which can recognize individuals the camera is spotting utilizing face recognition. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name.

Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also supply a wider variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
