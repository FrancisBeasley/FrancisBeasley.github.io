The other notable things about the Pro 2 are that unlike the Q Plus (the other Arlo design which I'm going to go over in just a second), it is created for outdoor along with indoor use, so it'll work come rain or shine. It likewise has a USB slot so you can record your footage straight onto there, which saves you needing to deal with the cloud storage system discussed above.</p>
