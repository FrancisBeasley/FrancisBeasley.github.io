Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just an incorrect sense of security because it avoids only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
