<h3>Camera Home Security System in Mississippi</h3>
<p>Ring may not be the most advanced system on our list (Vivint takes that reward), but it sure has gained quite the fanfare for many years. We've been evaluating Ring Alarm a fair bit lately, and we really like the system for what it is. So what is it?

<p>One important exception: ADT has a landline monitoring plan that's $36.99 per month, which could be a cost effective choice for consumers in backwoods.

If you live someplace without access to cellular monitoring, a landline system is still much better than no security at all.</p>
<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the severe environment.</p>
<p>Brinks Home Security, one of the recognized names in the market, recently got a facelift after MONI Smart Security purchased the name rights to the company and offered the company a major overhaul.

In regards to cost, Brinks is someplace in the mid-range: not the most inexpensive, however not the most pricey, either. </p>
