Whatever the parts are (camera, motion sensing unit, window sensor, clever lock, and so on), I want to make sure that they all quickly communicate with your app that is always at hand, so you can keep an eye on them from afar.</p>

Your wise home alarm system might not know the difference in between a pet and an intruder if your family pet sets off the motion sensor.
