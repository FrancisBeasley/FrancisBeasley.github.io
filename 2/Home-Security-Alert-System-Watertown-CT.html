<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely typical considering that the doorway and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, once clients recognize that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically too late because the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
