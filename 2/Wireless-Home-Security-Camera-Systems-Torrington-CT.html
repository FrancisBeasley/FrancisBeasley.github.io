<p>Price: Smart alarm can be more affordable due to the fact that consumers avoid paying somebody else to install or monitor them. False alarms frequently disturb neighbors. Alarms with exterior ringers often interrupt houses country miles from the immediate community. Next-door neighbors, whom they are suggested to notify, typically ignore the alarm.</p>
<p>As the name recommends, this alarm system is a starter set". So it's pretty much expected that it won't have extended customizability or a large range of functions.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
