<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky.

Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>
