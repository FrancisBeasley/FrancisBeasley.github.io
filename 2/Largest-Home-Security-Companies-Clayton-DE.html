<p>The cover of darkness isn't adequate to keep this late night lurker's identity hidden from Arlo's view. The one time where lag does end up being a little bit of a problem is between finding and taping motion. Because the Pro 2 does not do constant video recording, it takes a second for the camera to in fact turn on when it identifies motion. If a nefarious bad guy was quick enough, they might get past the camera before it had time to tape them.</p>

<p>The Frontpoint Security system, together with its Interactive strategy, was our favorite home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring strategies, and functions are almost identical to those of the Brinks system.
