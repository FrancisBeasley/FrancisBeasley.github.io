<p>For these separate systems to assemble or to integrate them together into a single interface, a comprehensive knowledge of all the needed systems is needed. If there are no as-built documents offering performance and setup information to make this integration work, there are only 2 alternatives.

The other approach is to rip and replace, performing a complete upgrade to a new security system that already has all the existing system requirements plus the ability to converge them all.</p>
<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is high-quality, if not especially groundbreaking, so we're really recommending the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free strategy alternative. Sure, you get a lower rate if you opt for a three-year agreement, but considering that Nest needs you to pay 100% of your staying contract if you cancel, it's a huge commitment. So choose what will be the much better offer for you. Go with the agreement and reap those savings if you understand you'll remain put for at least 3 years. But if you might upgrade to a new office with various security needs, contract-free is your best option.</p>

Or what if you've lastly gone on a much-needed trip and your spotty cell service means you do not get signaled till the next day?
