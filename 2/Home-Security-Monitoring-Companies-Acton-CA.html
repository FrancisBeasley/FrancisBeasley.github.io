A couple of minutes into the Do It Yourself installation, our tester got stuck getting her control board up and online-- it just would not link.

<p>Buy a rechargeable battery base also and you can put the weatherproof camera throughout Wi-Fi variety (it lasts approximately 3 months between charges).
