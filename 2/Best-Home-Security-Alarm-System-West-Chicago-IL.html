<p>I've covered consumer electronics for more than 15 years and have checked ratings of smart-home devices, from remotes and security cameras to AV receivers and speakers. As a previous editor for Electronic House and Big Picture Big Sound, I've composed purchasing guides for numerous consumer-electronics items, and I have actually composed articles covering technology for The New York Times (which is now Wirecutter's moms and dad company), Wired, Female's Day, Men's Health, and other publications.</p>

<p>When the alarm is tripped, an on-site ringer will typically set off a bell or siren connected to the structure. Likewise, when an automatic dialer alarm is tripped, a telephone call is immediately placed to the authorities or fire departments, and a pre-recorded statement is played when that call is answered. Automatic dialer alarms are not permitted to dial 9-1-1.</p>
<p>Recently, Ring rejected reports that it had suffered a data breach, however we agree with its recommendation that users should reset passwords and enable two-factor authentication as a precautionary measure. All smart-home devices are susceptible to such incidents. Nevertheless, after this most current entry in a year-long series of questionable media reports, we have actually decided to pull our suggestion of Ring's video doorbells. If you plan to pair the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first check out the What about Ring? section from our clever video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it pertains to video products, we do not believe that these issues change the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay positive in our present recommendation.</p>
