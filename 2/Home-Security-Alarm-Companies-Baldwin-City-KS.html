<p>We have actually long been fans of the Netatmo Welcome camera (₤ 199), with its downplayed looks and face acknowledgment software application. The latter enables you to see precisely when a specific person comes to your house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner appeared on time. But Netatmo has broadened its security range with a fantastic outdoor camera and security light, the Existence (₤ 249.99), and a three pack of weatherproof doors and window sensors called Tags (₤ 89.99).

We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to want to identify predicted visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) likewise provide a broader range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
