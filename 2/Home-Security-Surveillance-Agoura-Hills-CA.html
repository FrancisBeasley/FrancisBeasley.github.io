<p>Your CCTV camera may make you feel physically more secure, but after reading this post, it will sure make you feel essentially vulnerable. A few minutes into the DIY installation, our tester got stuck getting her control panel up and online-- it simply would not connect. An assistance window turned up with a number to call, and a Frontpoint representative helped her troubleshoot the connection. After about 10 minutes, he could tell there was a concern with the circuit board. Definitely not ideal-- but the representative apologized and delivered her replacement control panel overnight.</p>

Outdoor cameras will typically be built to be more durable and able to survive rain, frost, or damp.

Thankfully, I have actually tested out dozens of cameras and condensed whatever I've discovered into the list listed below.

<p>You can trigger the 80dB alarm if you do encounter a home invasion emergency situation. I am somewhat disappointed by the loudness of the alarm. At 80dB, it's about as loud as a food processor whereas lots of other alarm systems are as loud as 90dB or perhaps 105dB. Despite that, the alarm needs to be enough to scare away trespassers most of the times. To recover costs and hold alarm companies responsible for incorrect alarms, Seattle works straight with your alarm company rather of with you. Your alarm company should be licensed, pay any registration or false alarm fees, and offer physical evidence like camera footage or a damaged window to call for police response.</p>
