<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it provides protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air".

Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just an incorrect sense of security given that it prevents just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
