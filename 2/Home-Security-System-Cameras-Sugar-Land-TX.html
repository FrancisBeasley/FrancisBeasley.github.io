<p>Honeywell's Do It Yourself security system depends on a device called the Camera Base Station. It's an Amazon Echo-like device with a camera on top.

<p>The Google Nest Webcam IQ Outdoor is the most highly innovative outdoor camera we have actually evaluated. It has a close-up tracking function, which immediately zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high dynamic variety), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between basic motion and people, so it minimizes false alarms, and it can even determine individuals you have actually identified (after a learning duration). But like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face signals, which can recognize people the camera is finding utilizing face acknowledgment. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those people and will send out smartphone signals with that info when they appear at your home. We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to want to identify predicted visitors from random strangers. We likewise found the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to determine faces on a close-by TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also offer a broader variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
