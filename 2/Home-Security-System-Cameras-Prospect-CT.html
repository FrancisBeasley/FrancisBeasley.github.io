We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to want to distinguish anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise found the feature to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to determine faces on a close-by TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also supply a wider series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
