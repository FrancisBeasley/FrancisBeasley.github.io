<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can determine individuals the camera is spotting using face acknowledgment.

Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also supply a wider series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
