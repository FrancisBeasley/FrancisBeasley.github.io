<p>Another important subject to talk about is camera resolution. It can be confusing to comprehend how much is enough.

<p>Nevermind how excellent the cameras are. The first question you should be asking is which of these companies is offering your information to 3rd party companies? I've ditched my Nest Cams considering that they were purchased by Google. Something all of us need to think about. Sirens. So your camera has found intruders or wild animals. Do you want to scare them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will do the trick. Keep in mind that these sirens may breach local noise control laws, so check ahead of time prior to making the purchase.</p>
<p>When you aren't around, most intruders enter your home or business. The come during the day, when you're likely to be at work or running errands. Far from wearing a black catsuit, like you may have learned from the films, they'll wear a plain-clothes outfit to blend in. Particularly savvy wrongdoers will camouflage themselves as service or delivery workers. They don't spend inordinate quantities of time gunning through your belongings. They work quickly: most burglaries are committed within a span of 10 minutes or less.</p>
<p>So what happens if something triggers your alarm however you're in a meeting with a supplier and you do not get the alert? Or what if you've finally gone on a much-needed trip and your spotty cell service suggests you do not get alerted until the next day? The sound may scare off would-be burglars-- if you're fortunate if your system equipment includes an audible alarm. However the police won't come up until you personally call them. </p>
