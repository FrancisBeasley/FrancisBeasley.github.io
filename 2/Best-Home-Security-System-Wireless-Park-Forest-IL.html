<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely regular given that the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once customers realize that the affordable consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally too late given that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>

This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are dependable, however not suitable with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will likewise power the security cameras, removing the requirement for more wiring. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might require less circuitry in the walls but will still require cables to power the security camera separately, generally through 110VAC power. </p>
