<p>Primarily, it's difficult to dislike the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other picks, but it's better than a lot of cameras that are four times the rate. The field of vision is a narrow 110 degrees (compared with 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). However, after practically two years of use, night and day images have always been clear, and we never ever had issues with the camera missing out on motion, an issue we came across when checking the Wyze Web cam Pan And for those times when you're left wondering why your camera sent out a motion alert, Wyze has a clever feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It develops a green, on-screen box around the motion spotted. We've seen it highlight moths, vehicles, and mice.</p>

<p>Home security cameras have become extremely popular, specifically as wireless security cameras have ended up being more cost effective.
