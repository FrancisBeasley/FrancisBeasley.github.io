<p>From another location set state of mind lighting, control your thermostat, unlock your front door ... from anywhere, anytime. That's the power of Home Automation. Most wireless alarm are compatible with home automation functions. The apparent benefits are security and convenience, but home automation also assists to trim down those pesky energy expenses. That's money in the bank.</p>
<p>The disadvantage to a wireless system is that it depends on a wireless signal, meaning that storms and strong winds have the power to disrupt the system and could even activate false alarms. False alarms are known to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could result in fines from the provider or the cops if they happen often enough. Another possible downside to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment must be changed or charged frequently in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more pricey than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is generally balanced out by the reality that there are no installation costs.</p>
