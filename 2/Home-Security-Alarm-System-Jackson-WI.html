<p>From another location set state of mind lighting, control your thermostat, unlock your front door ... from anywhere, anytime. That's the power of Home Automation. Most wireless alarm are compatible with home automation functions. The apparent benefits are security and convenience, but home automation also assists to trim down those pesky energy expenses.

Wireless equipment can also be more pricey than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is generally balanced out by the reality that there are no installation costs.</p>
