<p>Cameras with built in wifi that talk to an existing network should be within 300 feet for optimal efficiency. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera close to the NVR is definitely something to be taken into account. For example if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of a problem however if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on 2nd story wall, this would cause a disruption in the signal. A wireless bridge is a great choice for long variety situations where trees and poles are not present.</p>
