Like the Arlo Pro 2, the Blink system also comes with a sync module that links to WiFi rather than using an ethernet cable to attach to your router, making things a bit easier.

<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, most alarm systems work the exact same method. They use open and closed circuits to move an electrical existing. When this electrical current is not being moved it sets off an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. If the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits, which indicates. If someone were to unlock that would imply that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then set off the alarm system.
