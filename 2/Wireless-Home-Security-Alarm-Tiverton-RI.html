You can inform the system who it is (if it's not an intruder), and next time around it must immediately know.</p>
<p>After testing lots of wired and wireless options, the best home security camera for many people is the Arlo Pro 2. It tapes high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is fully wireless, and can be established both indoors and out, as it's weather condition resistant.
