<p>We don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam due to the fact that it's more complicated than it should be. Recordings, informs, and integration all require different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are saved for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly charge (or $80 annually) to keep 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limitations, we typically found action missing out on, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
