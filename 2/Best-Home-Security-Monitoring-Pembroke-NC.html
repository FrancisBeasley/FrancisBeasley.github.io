<p>Definitely, a lot of homeowners have actually heard about home security systems, however lots of may not ensure the best type to buy, why they are so essential to have, and all of the sophisticated features of the new wireless home security systems on the market today.

<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it offers protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software to spot it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only an incorrect complacency given that it avoids only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
