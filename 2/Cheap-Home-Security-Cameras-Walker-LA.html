<p>The downside to a wireless system is that it depends on a wireless signal, implying that storms and strong winds have the power to interfere with the system and might even trigger false alarms. Incorrect alarms are known to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could lead to fines from the provider or the cops if they happen often enough. Another possible disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool should be changed or charged frequently in order to keep the system working.
