<p>Just recently, Ring denied reports that it had suffered an information breach, however we concur with its recommendation that users need to reset passwords and allow two-factor authentication as a precautionary step. All smart-home gadgets are vulnerable to such occurrences. Nevertheless, after this newest entry in a year-long series of controversial media reports, we have decided to pull our suggestion of Ring's video doorbells. If you prepare to pair the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially check out the What about Ring? section from our smart video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it pertains to video items, we do not believe that these issues alter the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay positive in our present recommendation.</p>
