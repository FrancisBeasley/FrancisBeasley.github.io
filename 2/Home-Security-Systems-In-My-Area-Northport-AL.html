Smaller sized, self-monitored systems are the most budget friendly choice. Remember that cameras with two-way audio normally work like walkie talkies.

<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it supplies protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air".

Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just a false sense of security considering that it avoids only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
