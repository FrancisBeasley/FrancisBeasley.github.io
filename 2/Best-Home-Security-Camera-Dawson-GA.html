<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely regular given that the doorway and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once customers understand that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's typically far too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
