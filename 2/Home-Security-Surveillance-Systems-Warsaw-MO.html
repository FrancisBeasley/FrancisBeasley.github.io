So I still have 21 months of a contract I had no idea I remained in, to go out I have to pay $783.  Actually annoying. Once again the sales individuals, or a minimum of mine, do not point out the 3 year dedication. I called their customer support team and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not need to mention it, it's on you to check out the fine print. I'm paying the lump sum, since obviously they car restore you at some time unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send in a written not by mail.
