<p>You can set off the 80dB alarm if you do come across a home invasion emergency situation. I am somewhat disappointed by the loudness of the alarm. At 80dB, it's about as loud as a food mill whereas numerous other alarm are as loud as 90dB or perhaps 105dB. Regardless of that, the alarm should be enough to scare away burglars for the most part. To recover expenses and hold alarm companies liable for incorrect alarms, Seattle works straight with your alarm company instead of with you. Your alarm company need to be accredited, pay any registration or false alarm fees, and provide physical evidence like camera footage or a damaged window to necessitate authorities response.</p>
