<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we could point them at the very same area and expose them all to the exact same lighting conditions and New England weather.

This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reliable, but not compatible with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, removing the need for more circuitry. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might need less wiring in the walls however will still require cable televisions to power the security camera independently, usually by means of 110VAC power. </p>
