In reality, the second half of the 19th century was a period of great innovation in the security industry. The first home alarm system was patented in 1853 by a Bostonian creator called Augustus Russell Pope.</p>
<p>The Google Nest Web Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technologically innovative outdoor camera we've tested. It has a close-up tracking feature, which automatically focuses on motion and then follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high vibrant range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can compare general motion and individuals, so it cuts down on incorrect alarms, and it can even determine people you've identified (after a learning duration). However like all Nest cameras, this one needs the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can determine people the camera is identifying utilizing face acknowledgment. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those people and will send out smart device informs with that details when they show up at your home. We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the function to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) likewise supply a wider range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
