<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, many burglar alarms work the specific same way. They use open and closed circuits to transfer an electrical current. When this electrical current is not being moved it sets off an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which indicates if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If someone were to open the door that would imply that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then trigger the burglar alarm.
