<p>Nothing is more important than securing what you treasure most ... your family and home. You do not have to buy a multi-million dollar surveillance system to keep an eye on your property and belongings. In the event that your alarm system is set off, your home security system sends a wireless alert to the monitoring company where security specialists are waiting to react by instantly contacting you and if need be, the regional medical, fire or police authorities.</p>
<p>Storage facilities - Storage facilities are likely home to much of your important stock, and therefore a prime spot for theft.

To keep these devices secure, it's recommended that customers regularly change their passwords and never ever share them with individuals outside the household. Make sure to change the manufactured password credentials instantly upon invoice and replace them with a passphrase that can not be quickly thought. Set a momentary password and reset it as soon as you return if you go on holiday and have somebody coming over to feed family pets or check on your home. As newer security systems shift to cloud-based, wireless platforms, it is very important to secure yourself against network intrusion just as you would with safeguarding your identity and virtual assets online.</p>

That's still significant, but it's a lot less than the average loss of a burglary. While the rate of robberies nationally has actually reduced, the average loss has increased-- in 2018, that number was close to $3,0002 (more on that in the theft data section above).</p>
