<p>But while SimpliSafe has less customer care schedule, it offers monetary flexibility that ADT does not match. Due to the fact that SimpliSafe monitoring plans are optional, you can cancel your monitoring service any time if you require extra money for holiday presents, medical bills, or moving expenditures.

The camera includes features like complimentary streamable HD video and audio, 30-day storage, and night vision, but it does not take snapshots of activity and can't move or pan-- basic functions found on a lot of surveillance cameras. </p>
