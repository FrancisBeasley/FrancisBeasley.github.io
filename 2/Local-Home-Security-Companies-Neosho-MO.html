<p>After evaluating lots of wired and wireless options, the best home security camera for the majority of people is the Arlo Pro 2. It tape-records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is totally wireless, and can be set up both indoors and out, as it's weather condition resistant.

But you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the likes of Vivint or Brinks.</p>
