<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as notifications that compare people and general motion. We think that's expensive.</p>
