<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely typical given that the doorway and room seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as customers recognize that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually too late given that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>

Our tester stated the professional offered solid customer care: He dropped a few unnecessary window sensing units from my expense after deciding that the motion detector sufficed for the entire front half of my home."
