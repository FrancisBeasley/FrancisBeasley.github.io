<p>Nothing is more important than protecting what you treasure most ... your household and home. The implicit reason for the recent push to increase video surveillance is the risk of terrorist attacks. But suicide assailants are plainly not hindered by video cameras - and may even be drawn in to the tv coverage cameras can make sure - and the cost of a comprehensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up approximately 20 percent of that country's criminal justice budget - far exceeds the restricted advantages that the system might supply in examining attacks or attempted attacks after the truth (see truth sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>

<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational information to a destructive assaulter, considering that the disturbance of the network prevents the flow of information and really indirectly secures data by preventing it from being transferred. The normal reason for performing a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, throughout which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all gadgets, providing a chance for the malicious assaulter to tape these codes and utilize various cracking tools to analyze security weak points and exploit them to gain unauthorized access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools available which can launch a dictionary style attack of "potentially accepted" security keys based on the "model" security essential captured throughout the network recovery.</p>
<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it supplies protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software application to identify it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just a false complacency because it prevents only "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
