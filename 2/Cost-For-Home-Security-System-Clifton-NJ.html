<p>I described that all we would require to do is use any one of the emergency call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which likewise consisted of two-way audio, and that camera would become the interface into the VMS system. When a client pushes the emergency situation button, it sends dual signals: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. In addition, if the main patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would examine the threat and, if needed, might just push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific floor.</p>

<p>What to consider: Basic cellular alarm monitoring is $39.99 per month, but you'll pay a bit more if you wish to include extra functions, like a security camera.
