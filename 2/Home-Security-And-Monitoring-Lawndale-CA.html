We select each representative carefully, and we treat your home security as if it were our own. This implies you get an immediate response from a real person. Every minute. Every day. Guaranteed.</p>
<p>We didn't consider alarm systems that needed expert installation. Pro-installed systems typically cost more, use equipment comparable to that of Do It Yourself systems, come with long and typically burdensome agreements, and frequently rely on the very same monitoring companies that self-installed systems use, so they use little advantage. A fine example is the Vivint system, which we have actually reviewed separately and do not recommend for most people.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, this alarm system is a starter set". So it's practically expected that it won't have actually extended customizability or a large range of functions. Nevertheless, I am still disappointed that they haven't consisted of at least a basic camera with this package. Cameras are quite basic for self monitored alarm systems, especially due to the fact that false alarms is a really real possibility.</p>
<p>Vivint is among the pioneers of home automation innovation on the market today. Therefore, the panel and the app they feature for the use of this system have been fine-tuned make it very simple to use.

<p>The Hive View provides terrific 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation activated too quickly, even when on the lowest level of sensitivity setting. Given that this camera has no native geofencing features, you have to manually stop notifications (and recording, considering that it does that even when notifications are off).
