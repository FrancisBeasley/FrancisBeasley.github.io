<h3>CCTV Home Security System in New York</h3>
<p>This system uses an electro-magnetic field disturbance principle based upon two unshielded (or 'dripping') coaxial cables buried around 30 cm (1 feet) deep and 1 m (10 feet) apart. 6 The transmitter discharges constant Radio Frequency (RF) energy along one cable and the energy is received by the other cable television. When the modification in field strength damages due to the presence of an item and reaches a pre-set lower limit, an alarm condition is created. The system is hidden after installation. Care needs to be required to guarantee the surrounding soil offers good drainage in order to prevent annoyance alarms.</p>
<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to identify any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to disregard objects that put in percentages of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is susceptible to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to prevent this type of attack.</p>

Keep in mind that these sirens may break local sound control laws, so inspect ahead of time prior to making the purchase.</p>
