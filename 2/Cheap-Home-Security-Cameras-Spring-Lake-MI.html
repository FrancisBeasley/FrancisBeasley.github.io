<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," enabling them to catch clear video in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a lit up room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording video in the dark is a priority.</p>
