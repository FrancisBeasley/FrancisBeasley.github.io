For example, if you have family pets that are over 30 pounds, you will need a security system whose motion sensing units can be changed or a system that can be installed in such a method that your large family pets will not trigger false alarms to be sent out each time your animal moves. If you have large animals, you might want to think about avoiding the motion sensors and rely more on the window and door sensing units which aren't triggered by motion but are set off when a window or door is opened.</p>

We 'd most likely recommend a company like Vivint, ADT, or Frontpoint if you're starting from scratch.</p>
