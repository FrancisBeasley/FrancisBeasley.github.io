<p>Nothing is more vital than safeguarding what you treasure most ... your household and home. You do not need to invest in a multi-million dollar surveillance system to watch on your property and belongings.

<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it offers protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software to find it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only an incorrect sense of security because it prevents only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
