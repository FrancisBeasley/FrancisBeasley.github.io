<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to capture clear footage in dark conditions.

The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if catching video in the dark is a priority.</p>
