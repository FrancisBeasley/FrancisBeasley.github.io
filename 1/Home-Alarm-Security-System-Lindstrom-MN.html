<p>For these separate systems to converge or to incorporate them together into a single interface, a comprehensive understanding of all the needed systems is essential. If there are no as-built files supplying performance and configuration information to make this combination work, there are only two alternatives. The first option, which might be the most complicated, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the initial option provider is not available or reluctant to offer those details) and record the topology and how they can be included into the new DVS system.

<p>The Google Nest Camera IQ Outdoor is the most highly innovative outdoor camera we've evaluated. It has a close-up tracking feature, which automatically focuses on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high vibrant range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can compare general motion and individuals, so it minimizes incorrect alarms, and it can even determine people you have actually identified (after a knowing duration). But like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can recognize people the camera is spotting using face acknowledgment. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to identify those people and will send out smart device signals with that info when they appear at your home. We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to want to differentiate anticipated visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to determine faces on a close-by TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also supply a larger variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
