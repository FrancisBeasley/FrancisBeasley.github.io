<p>Our burglar alarms may be equipped in the Away" or Stay" mode. Once the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to recognize an infraction. When a zone has been breached, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transmits the message through a telephone line. When the signal is received, the intruder alarm system will wait to send out another message if another zone is tripped.
