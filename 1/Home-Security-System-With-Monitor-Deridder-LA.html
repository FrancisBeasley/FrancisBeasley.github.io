Sensing units If you do not desire a camera in every room you should install a motion detector (at least in the hallways) that can send alerts and set of an alarm.

<p>Our burglar alarms may be equipped in the Away" or Stay" mode. Once the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to recognize an infraction. When a zone has been breached, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transmits the message through a telephone line. When the signal is received, the intruder alarm system will wait to send out another message if another zone is tripped. Getting in the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and turning off the system will end this procedure with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
