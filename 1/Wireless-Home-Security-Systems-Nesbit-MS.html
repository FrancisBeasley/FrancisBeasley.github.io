<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it offers protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air".

In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only a false sense of security because it prevents just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
