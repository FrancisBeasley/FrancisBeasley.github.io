<p>You can set off the 80dB alarm if you do encounter a home invasion emergency. I am somewhat disappointed by the loudness of the alarm. At 80dB, it has to do with as loud as a food mill whereas lots of other alarm systems are as loud as 90dB and even 105dB. Despite that, the alarm needs to suffice to scare away intruders in most cases. To recoup expenses and hold alarm companies liable for incorrect alarms, Seattle works directly with your alarm company rather of with you. Your alarm company need to be accredited, pay any registration or incorrect alarm costs, and supply physical proof like camera footage or a damaged window to necessitate authorities action.</p>
