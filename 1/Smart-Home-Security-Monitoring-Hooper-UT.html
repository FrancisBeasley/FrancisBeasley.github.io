We also experienced above-average connection problems, with 2 Hive test systems disconnecting eight times over two months.</p>

<p>Another factor to consider with wireless home security systems is the minimal variety of sensors. A lot of radio frequencies are weak outside a series of 500 feet. This suggests that you have to structure your wireless system with this in mind, specifically if your property is bigger than 4,500 square feet. When aiming to buy a surveillance camera, there are a couple of elements to think about.</p>
