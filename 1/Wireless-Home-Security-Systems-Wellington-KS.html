Out of our top options of wireless home security companies, 3 deal DIY installation.

<p>The Nest IQ is a seriously remarkable piece of technology. For starters, it looks gorgeous: the all-white design and black camera face are seriously spacey (if eerily reminiscent of the AI in 2001: A Space Odyssey). It's far from the horrid metal CCTV box that you may call to mind when you envision a home security camera. The first wireless function to think about is the security system and its elements, and how they all link. In the past, every monitoring part was hard-wired back to a panel box. This implied every door and window required its own wire and course of holes through your house.</p>
