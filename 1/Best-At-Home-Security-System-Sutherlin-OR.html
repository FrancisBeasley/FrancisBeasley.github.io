<p>Analog security cameras transmit lower resolution video over coax cable and record to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) which can deal with such things as scheduling, motion detection, and digital zoom. The DVR transforms the analog signal to digital, compresses it, and then stores it on a hard disk drive for later retrieval.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not great-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have horrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>

<p>Stopped working authorizations need to lead to an alarm or at least a timed lockout to avoid experimenting with possible codes.  Some systems can be configured to permit deactivation of private sensing units or groups.  High-end systems enable several access codes, and might even allow them to be utilized only as soon as, or on specific days, or only in combination with other users' codes (i.e., escorted). In any case, a remote monitoring center need to arrange an oral code to be provided by a licensed individual in case of incorrect alarms, so the monitoring center can be guaranteed that a further alarm response is unnecessary. Just like gain access to codes, there can also be a hierarchy of oral codes, say, for heater repairperson to enter the kitchen area and basement sensing unit areas but not the silver vault in the pantry. There are also systems that permit a pressure code to be gotten in and silence the local alarm, but still set off the remote alarm to summon the police to a break-in.</p>
