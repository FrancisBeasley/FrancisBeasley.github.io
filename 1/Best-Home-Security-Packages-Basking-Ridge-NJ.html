<p>The Frontpoint Security system, along with its Interactive strategy, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring strategies, and functions are almost identical to those of the Brinks system. However, Frontpoint's plans are slightly more expensive for the very same level of service, its agreements are longer, its cancellation fees are burdensome, and its pricing is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer suggest anyway.</p>
<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear video in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a lit up space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see during the night. If catching video footage in the dark is a priority, make certain your camera has lots of IR LEDs.</p>
<p>Outdoor security cameras are typically more pricey than their indoor equivalents. They can vary in cost from around $100 approximately $400 depending upon functions. There are a lot of budget-friendly cameras available that deal good video performance, however as with almost any smart device, you'll pay more for features such as motion tracking, facial recognition, cellular connection, time-lapse recording, both onboard and cloud storage options, and rechargeable battery power. </p>
