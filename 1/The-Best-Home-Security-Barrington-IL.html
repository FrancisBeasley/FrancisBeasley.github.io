<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, many burglar alarms work the exact very same way. They use open and closed circuits to transfer an electric present. When this electrical current is not being transferred it triggers a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which implies if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if someone were to open the door that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be moved.
