Some systems can be configured to permit deactivation of private sensing units or groups.  High-end systems allow several access codes, and might even allow them to be used just when, or on particular days, or only in mix with other users' codes (i.e., accompanied).

Similar to access codes, there can likewise be a hierarchy of oral codes, say, for furnace repairperson to go into the kitchen area and basement sensing unit locations but not the silver vault in the kitchen.
