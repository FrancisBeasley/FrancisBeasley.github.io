Whatever the components are (camera, motion sensor, window sensor, clever lock, and so on), I wish to ensure that they all quickly communicate with your app that is always at hand, so you can watch on them from afar.</p>

Utilize them sparingly and make certain you follow placement instructions to the letter.</p>
