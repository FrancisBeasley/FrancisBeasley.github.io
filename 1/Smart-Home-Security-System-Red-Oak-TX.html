<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that speak to an existing network must be within 300 feet for optimal efficiency. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's placement of the camera close to the NVR is absolutely something to be taken into consideration. For instance if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of a problem however if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on 2nd story wall, this would trigger a disruption in the signal. A wireless bridge is an excellent option for long range situations where poles and trees are not present.</p>

The app is slick and nice, matching the camera's own neat design, and you can control the Circle by means of Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit or among Logitech's Pop clever home buttons.</p>
