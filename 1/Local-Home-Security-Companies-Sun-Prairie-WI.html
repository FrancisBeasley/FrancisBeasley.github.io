<p>While every homeowner worries about burglaries, apprehension has surrounded home security systems due to their generally high expenses, complex contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces typically leading to incorrect alarms. A security camera system is a whole video surveillance system linked together by a series of security cameras and network video recorders, providing trusted video monitoring around your home and business. 145 years ago, we created security and alarm monitoring services.

<p>Surveillance systems present law enforcement "bad apples" with a tempting chance for criminal abuse.
