<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational data to a destructive opponent, since the interruption of the network avoids the circulation of data and really indirectly safeguards data by preventing it from being sent. The normal reason for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, during which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, offering an opportunity for the malicious assailant to tape-record these codes and use numerous cracking tools to examine security weak points and exploit them to gain unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools available which can release a dictionary style attack of "potentially accepted" security keys based upon the "design" security key caught throughout the network recovery.</p>

Purchase good door locks and window locks, and ensure important locations like entrances and the cash register are well-lit.</p>
