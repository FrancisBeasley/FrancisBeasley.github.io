<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to check in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We initially observed Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E But once we attempted it out, it quickly became a personnel (and friends and family) favorite. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a sound maker. It can't send signals, you can't manage it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>

Systems like Nest Secure, House, and Ring Alarm will all let you self-monitor your system totally free. But Scout makes you pay a $10 month-to-month membership charge. Wamp wamp.
