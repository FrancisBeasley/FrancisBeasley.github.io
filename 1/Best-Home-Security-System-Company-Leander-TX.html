<p>We provide value-added security and surveillance systems and services offering convenience, assurance and complete satisfaction to every consumer and are dedicated to fulfilling our consumer's needs with stability, sincerity, interest and outstanding service. Dependability has long been at the heart of the argument over hardwired versus wireless home security systems. It's a debate that's often skewed by elements such as uncertainty over the vulnerability of wireless systems, including interference from radio signals and problems that cause incorrect alarms. While enhancements in recent years have actually made the innovation more robust and popular (some systems today have their own unique wireless innovation, which can't be disrupted by other signals), issues continue over vulnerabilities that don't affect hardwired systems.</p>
