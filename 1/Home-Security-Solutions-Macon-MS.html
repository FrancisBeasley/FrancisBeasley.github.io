Normally, consumer-grade cameras are constructed to work well when there is plenty of available light, and when the lighting becomes low or absent (believe sundown or nighttime), their pedigree begins to reveal.

This is a pricey security camera, however we think it deserves the investment.

Lots of sites needing alarm installations no longer have conventional telephone lines (POTS), and alarm panels with conventional telephone dialer capability do not work reliably over some kinds of VoIP service.</p>
