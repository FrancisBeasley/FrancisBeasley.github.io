<p>Absolutely nothing is more vital than protecting what you treasure most ... your family and home. The implicit justification for the current push to increase video surveillance is the threat of terrorist attacks.

<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi communicates with recorder that likewise has actually built in wifi. Since no established wifi is required, this option is rather popular.
