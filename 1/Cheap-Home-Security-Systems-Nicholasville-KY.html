<p>The disadvantage to a wireless system is that it counts on a wireless signal, meaning that storms and strong winds have the power to interfere with the system and might even activate false alarms. False alarms are known to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could lead to fines from the provider or the police if they happen frequently enough. Another possible disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool need to be changed or charged routinely in order to keep the system working.
