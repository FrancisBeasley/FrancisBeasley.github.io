Nevertheless, bear in mind that the monitoring company's reaction time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will react to the alarm-- if they react at all. In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls should be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City needs confirmation from a personal security guard. A number of cities also require an authorization to even own and operate a home security system. Rules such as these are designed to restrict the time and resources that police and fire departments waste on incorrect alarms. Many municipalities will fine you for too many incorrect alarms.</p>
