The normal factor for performing a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, during which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, offering a chance for the malicious aggressor to tape-record these codes and utilize different splitting tools to evaluate security weak points and exploit them to acquire unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools readily available which can release a dictionary style attack of "possibly accepted" security keys based on the "design" security key recorded throughout the network healing.</p>

These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a lit up room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see at night. If capturing video in the dark is a top priority, make sure your camera has a lot of IR LEDs.</p>
