<p>Home security systems are a one-time investment that can settle, huge time, down the line. Does the right system have all the bells and whistles, from facial acknowledgment to floodlights?

<p>There's no dedicated hub involved here - each camera links straight to your router by means of Wi-Fi, and streams to your phone (or to the outside world) from there.

<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it supplies protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software to find it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just an incorrect complacency considering that it avoids just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
