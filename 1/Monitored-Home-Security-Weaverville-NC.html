Techniques consisted of searches of electronic bibliographic databases, manual searches of CCTV assessment research study bibliographies, forward searches of CCTV assessments, and calling leading researchers to ask about upcoming assessments. Both released and unpublished reports were included in the search, which was not limited to the English language and was global in scope.</p>
