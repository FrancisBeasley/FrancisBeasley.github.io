The main specialty that wired security companies have is that the systems can be more reputable than a wireless system.

<p>Nevertheless, wired systems aren't without their downsides. They tend to be more pricey to install, requiring the expertise of certified specialists. As facilities, sensing units and circuitry need to be placed inside the walls, which involves drilling and connecting sensing units to low-voltage wires, so there's contractor labor to think about.
