<p>A tight wire boundary security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to find any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensing units to ignore things that exert percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is set up to avoid this kind of attack.</p>
