<p>The Nest Camera Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were impressive in our testing-- during the day and in the evening-- with a broad, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We need to keep in mind that the camera would periodically downgrade the photo quality based on offered bandwidth, which could fluctuate throughout the day.

They can select wired or wireless systems without much inconvenience.</p>
<p>For all the advantages of Nest Secure, the quality of client service is not one of them.
