<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  If you wish to leave the contract you need to pay 75% of the contract.  So I still have 21 months of a contract I had no idea I remained in, to get out I have to pay $783.  Really frustrating. Once again the sales people, or a minimum of mine, do not mention the 3 year dedication. I called their customer care team and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not have to discuss it, it's on you to read the fine print. I'm paying the lump amount, since obviously they vehicle renew you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send out in a written not by mail.
