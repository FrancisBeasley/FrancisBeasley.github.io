<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can determine individuals the camera is spotting using face recognition. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name.

We also found the function to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also supply a wider range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
