<p>You can activate the 80dB alarm if you do experience a home invasion emergency. I am somewhat disappointed by the loudness of the alarm.

To recoup expenses and hold alarm companies responsible for false alarms, Seattle works directly with your alarm company rather of with you. Your alarm company must be accredited, pay any registration or incorrect alarm fees, and supply physical proof like camera video or a broken window to require cops response.</p>
