Like the other cameras here, it's a Wi-Fi-connected gadget that begins recording when it senses movement. Hampton Products will release an outdoor camera under its Range by Hampton line this spring. The wire-free camera promises approximately 4 months of battery life, a 110-degree viewing angle, and color night vision.</p>

The latter allows you to see precisely when a specific individual arrives at your house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner showed up on time. But Netatmo has actually expanded its security range with a dazzling outdoor camera and security light, the Existence (₤ 249.99), and a three pack of weatherproof doors and window sensing units known as Tags (₤ 89.99).
