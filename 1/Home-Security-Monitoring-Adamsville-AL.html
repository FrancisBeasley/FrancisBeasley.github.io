<p>Nothing is more vital than securing what you treasure most ... your family and home. You do not have to invest in a multi-million dollar surveillance system to watch on your residential or commercial property and belongings. In the event that your alarm system is set off, your home security system sends out a wireless alert to the monitoring company where security specialists are standing by to react by instantaneously contacting you and if need be, the local medical, fire or police authorities.</p>
