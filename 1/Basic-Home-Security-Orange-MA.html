<p>I discussed that all we would need to do is take advantage of any one of the emergency situation call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also consisted of two-way audio, which camera would end up being the user interface into the VMS system. When a client presses the emergency situation button, it sends dual notifies: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Moreover, if the main patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, indicating that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the danger and, if required, could just press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular floor.</p>
