<p>Your CCTV camera may make you feel physically more secure, however after reading this post, it will sure make you feel essentially vulnerable. The other notable features of the Pro 2 are that unlike the Q Plus (the other Arlo design which I'm going to talk about in simply a second), it is designed for outdoor as well as indoor use, so it'll work come rain or shine.
