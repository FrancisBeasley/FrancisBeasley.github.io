<p>A taut wire boundary security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to find any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensors to ignore things that apply percentages of pressure on the wires.
