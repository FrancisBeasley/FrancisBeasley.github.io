<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally normal since the entrance and space seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
