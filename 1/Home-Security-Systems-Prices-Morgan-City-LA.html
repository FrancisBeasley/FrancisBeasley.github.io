There are a couple of things to consider prior to picking a wireless option, one being what type is going to be the most useful.

Being able to distinguish between a person and a car, for example, allows you to minimize unnecessary notifies. And Activity Zones are a great perk, specifically if you're looking to monitor a specific corner of the backyard, a doorway, or perhaps trash bin. </p>
