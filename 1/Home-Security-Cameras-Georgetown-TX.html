As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally normal since the entrance and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when clients realize that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's usually too late because the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
