<p>If you do come across a home intrusion emergency, you can set off the 80dB alarm. I am slightly disappointed by the loudness of the alarm. At 80dB, it's about as loud as a food mill whereas many other alarm systems are as loud as 90dB or perhaps 105dB. In spite of that, the alarm should suffice to scare away burglars in many cases. To recoup costs and hold alarm companies responsible for incorrect alarms, Seattle works directly with your alarm company rather of with you. Your alarm company should be accredited, pay any registration or false alarm fees, and supply physical proof like camera video footage or a damaged window to call for authorities action.</p>
