The one time where lag does become a little a problem is in between recording and finding movement. Since the Pro 2 doesn't do continuous video recording, it takes a second for the camera to actually turn on when it identifies motion. If a nefarious lawbreaker was fast enough, they could surpass the camera prior to it had time to tape-record them.</p>
<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it offers protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software application to spot it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only a false complacency since it avoids just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
