<p>Cameras frequently relay video footage online, enabling operators to monitor security camera feeds from another location.

<p>One essential exception: ADT has a landline monitoring strategy that's $36.99 monthly, which might be a budget friendly option for customers in rural areas. We suggest cellular systems because they're far more secure than landline systems, but there are some places where cellular monitoring isn't readily available. If you live somewhere without access to cellular monitoring, a landline system is still far better than no security at all.</p>
<p>Siren Several one-box systems like Canary and Somfy come with a very loud built-in siren that should ideally frighten burglars (or next door's feline). Expect to see more sirens, both indoor and out, over the coming year as the clever brand names expand their ranges. If you get a billing for extreme incorrect alarms, you might appeal it.
