The deals of free monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurance providers cast doubt on the suitability of the present pattern in U.S. policing of permitting three or 4 totally free incorrect alarms per calendar year, since they provide no up-front rewards to encourage owners to prevent false alarms.</p>
