<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally typical given that the entrance and room seem at the exact same brightness level.
