<p>Among the top home security companies since getting in the business in 1992, Protect America provides service for numerous thousands of clients around the United States and Canada. They use flexibility in their equipment and offered strategies, permitting property owners to select the security solution that best fits their requirements. Sadly, there are some disadvantages to Safeguard America indicated by their low C- ranking from BBB. A bulk of the problems center around misinformation regarding the obligatory 3 year agreement. In reality, many customers were not conscious they were making such a long term dedication. This, combined with the extreme penalty for premature cancellation-100% of the remaining balance plus spending for all of the equipment-may offer some pause in choosing Protect America as their home security option.</p>
<p>So why do not we rank ADT higher? In some ways, ADT irritates us. We see a lot of growing companies branching off and attempting new things in the home security space. But ADT isn't keeping up. It costs a lot, its pricing isn't constantly transparent, and it still has long contracts. Not to point out that the client service experience varies widely depending upon the dealer you opt for. </p>
