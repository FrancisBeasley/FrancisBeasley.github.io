<p>The cover of darkness isn't adequate to keep this late night lurker's identity hidden from Arlo's view. The one time where lag does end up being a little an issue is between spotting and tape-recording motion. Since the Pro 2 does not do continuous video recording, it takes a second for the camera to really turn on when it spots motion. They could get past the camera before it had time to tape them if a wicked wrongdoer was fast enough.</p>

Our tester went with the Interactive strategy but ended up disappointed with its lack of live video surveillance.

It turned out to be an incorrect alarm-- one she paid the local authorities $150 for.</p>
