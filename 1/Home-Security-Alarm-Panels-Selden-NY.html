<h2>How Are Burglar Alarm Systems Monitored in Selden</h2>
<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  , if you desire to get out of the agreement you have to pay 75% of the agreement..

I called their client service team and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not need to mention it, it's on you to check out the fine print. I'm paying the lump amount, since obviously they car restore you at some time unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send in a composed not by mail.
