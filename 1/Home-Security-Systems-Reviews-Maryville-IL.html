No-contract systems, which permit you to spend for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis instead of dedicating to a long-term plan, are becoming more common. These systems sometimes cost more up front for the hardware than professional systems that use a discount in exchange for that prolonged service contract. Spending for the equipment up front provides you with a great deal of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you use the service. And you can stop the monitoring and begin service as often times as you desire.</p>
