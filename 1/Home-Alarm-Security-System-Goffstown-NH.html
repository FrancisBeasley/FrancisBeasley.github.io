<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it supplies protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software to detect it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only a false sense of security considering that it avoids just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
