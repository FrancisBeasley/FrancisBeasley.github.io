We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to want to distinguish predicted visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TV).
