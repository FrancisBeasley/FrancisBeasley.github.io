<p>The Hive View provides fantastic 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation triggered too quickly, even when on the lowest level of sensitivity setting. Since this camera has no native geofencing features, you need to manually stop alerts (and recording, considering that it does that even when notices are off). We also experienced above-average connection problems, with two Hive test units disconnecting eight times over two months.</p>

<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the extreme environment.</p>
