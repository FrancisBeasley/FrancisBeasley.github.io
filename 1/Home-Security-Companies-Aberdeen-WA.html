<h3>Surveillance Security Camera Aberdeen WA 98520</h3>
<p>The Blink XT2 is small, runs on two AA batteries, and includes a year's worth of totally free cloud storage, and it captures a much better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a choice? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, smartphone alerts and live views were painfully slow, and the variety is bad. Also, if the camera is in the middle of recording, don't anticipate to get a live peek or make any settings changes-- it can't multitask.</p>
