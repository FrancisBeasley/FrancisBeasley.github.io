When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to identify those people and will send smartphone notifies with that info when they show up at your home. We think this feature (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to want to identify expected visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to determine faces on a close-by TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also supply a wider range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
