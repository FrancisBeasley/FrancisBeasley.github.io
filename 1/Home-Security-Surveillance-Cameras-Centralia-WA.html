It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that compare people and general motion.
