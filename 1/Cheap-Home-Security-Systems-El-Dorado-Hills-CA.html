Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to spot any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a basic mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to neglect objects that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires.

<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face alerts, which can recognize individuals the camera is spotting using face acknowledgment. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those people and will send out smartphone signals with that details when they show up at your home. We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to differentiate predicted visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also provide a larger series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
