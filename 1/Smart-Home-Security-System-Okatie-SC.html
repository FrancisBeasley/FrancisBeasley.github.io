<h3>House Security Alarm System in Okatie SC</h3>

<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to check in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We initially noticed Wyze because its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E But once we tried it out, it quickly ended up being a staff (and family and friends) favorite. I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a noise maker.
