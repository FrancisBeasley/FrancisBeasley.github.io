<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range".

As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally regular considering that the doorway and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of recording video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
