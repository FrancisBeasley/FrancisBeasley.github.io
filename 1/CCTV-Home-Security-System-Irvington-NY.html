<p>All of this will cost you, though: A single camera (with the center) is $399, and additional cameras are $299 each. The Arlo Ultra does not featured a free tier of cloud storage, so you have to invest a minimum of $3 each month if you want to conserve any videos.

<p>There is a new pattern in surveillance video search technology that is rapidly changing the security industry, and it is called Deep Learning". What is Deep Learning and why is it so important?  For beginners, Deep Learning enables someone to discover what they are looking for without needing to explore hours of ineffective video footage.  Picture a website that works a lot like a Google search, where you can describe the aspects you are searching for in the taped video footage.  For example, if we need to see all video from today that has a police car in it, we just type police" into the search window and in seconds every secret frame of video with a patrol car appears.  With deep learning video search, you now have an effective solution for gathering and capturing crooks proof.</p>

The videos your camera records most likely won't be saved on the camera itself.
