<p>Surveillance systems present law enforcement "bad apples" with an appealing opportunity for criminal abuse. In 1997, for instance, a top-ranking police official in Washington, DC was captured utilizing authorities databases to collect details on customers of a gay club.

Your alarm company should be accredited, pay any registration or incorrect alarm fees, and provide physical evidence like camera video footage or a broken window to necessitate police reaction.</p>
