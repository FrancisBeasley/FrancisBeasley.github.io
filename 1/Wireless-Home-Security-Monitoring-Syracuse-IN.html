<p>According to a report, homes that don't have a security system are three times most likely to be robbed. Brinks owns and runs its own US-based monitoring center. Its monitoring service includes an advantage called ASAPer, which simultaneously messages a group of pre-set contacts to determine whether alarm activity is a true emergency situation or false alarm. Most monitoring center call household members one at a time, which can slow action times.</p>
