<p>The possible worth of public surveillance technology was well shown all the way back in April, 2013 when detectives identified the two suspects in the Boston Marathon battle after sorting through video images caught by the city's cameras. We suggest the 8-piece security kit as the best method to take full advantage of Ring's inexpensive home security options because we know all the ins and outs of Ring Alarm. Unless you only have one door and one window, you'll require more than the lone contact sensing unit that is available in Ring's five-piece package.</p>
<p>What really sets this model apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be expensive but is necessary. In truth, we do not suggest purchasing this camera at all unless you prepare to include the membership. Without it, you will not get the person-detection function, adjustable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated locations within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, a comprehensive, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera discovered activity. Being able to compare an automobile and a person, for example, enables you to reduce unnecessary notifies. And Activity Zones are a nice perk, especially if you're looking to monitor a specific corner of the yard, a doorway, or perhaps trash bin. </p>
