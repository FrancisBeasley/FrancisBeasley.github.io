<p>Just recently, Ring rejected reports that it had actually suffered a data breach, but we agree with its suggestion that users should reset passwords and make it possible for two-factor authentication as a preventive measure. All smart-home devices are vulnerable to such events. However, after this latest entry in a year-long series of questionable media reports, we have decided to pull our recommendation of Ring's video doorbells. If you prepare to match the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first check out the What about Ring? area from our smart video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it comes to video products, we don't believe that these problems change the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay positive in our present recommendation.</p>

Finally, if you simply want to see what your workers are up to when you aren't close by, a hidden camera connected to a CCTV camera system may be the very best option.</p>
