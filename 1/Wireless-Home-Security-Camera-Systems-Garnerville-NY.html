<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great however good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>

That said, iSmartAlarm works with IFTTT too. Through IFTTT, you can link iSmart to other popular home automation gadgets like SmartThings, WeMo, Ring Doorbells, Nest, Philips Color, and more. You can include a smart plug to the iSmart system if you do not want to expand into home automation through IFTTT. The clever plug can be used to automate small devices and lamps.
