<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to check in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike. We initially discovered Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E But once we tried it out, it rapidly became a staff (and friends and family) fave. I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a sound maker. It can't send out informs, you can't manage it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>

It has a close-up tracking function, which instantly zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high dynamic range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between basic motion and individuals, so it minimizes incorrect alarms, and it can even identify individuals you have actually labeled (after a learning duration). But like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
