<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the big amount of information required by digital video and high resolutions at very fast speeds, and often over fars away.

In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the requirement for further electrical wiring. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might need less electrical wiring in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera separately, typically by means of 110VAC power. </p>
