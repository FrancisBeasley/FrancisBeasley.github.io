<p>The downside to a wireless system is that it depends on a wireless signal, suggesting that storms and strong winds have the power to interrupt the system and could even activate false alarms. False alarms are understood to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could result in fines from the provider or the cops if they happen frequently enough. Another prospective drawback to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment should be replaced or charged frequently in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more costly than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is usually offset by the reality that there are no installation expenses.</p>
<p>If you opt for a professionally installed system, a security company will make more money. Typically, in this circumstances, a security company will oftentimes give you the equipment for free and provide you with a free installation.
