<p>The Blink XT2 is small, runs on 2 AA batteries, and consists of a year's worth of free cloud storage, and it captures a much better image and longer clips than its predecessors.

As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
