<p>Essentially, the Nest camera sits wherever you put it and records what it sees, conserving the last 5 days of video footage to the cloud. The wide face of the camera gives you a remarkable field of view, and the photo you get is of good quality (you can change the resolution; the better it gets, the more information you'll utilize to save it to the cloud.)
