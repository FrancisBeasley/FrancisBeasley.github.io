<p>The Frontpoint Security system, in addition to its Interactive strategy, was our favorite home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and features are practically identical to those of the Brinks system. Nevertheless, Frontpoint's plans are slightly more expensive for the very same level of service, its agreements are longer, its cancellation costs are difficult, and its pricing is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer recommend anyhow.</p>
