<p>We don't suggest the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complex than it should be. Recordings, informs, and combination all need different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are kept for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly charge (or $80 per year) to store 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limitations, we frequently found action missing out on, thanks to prolonged and irregular spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>

Some convenient people enjoy this approach, others not a lot, however it usually does not matter since the process is quite easy.
