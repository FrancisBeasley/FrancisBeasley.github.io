<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally regular because the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as consumers understand that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's typically too late since the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
