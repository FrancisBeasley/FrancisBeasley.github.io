In our screening, however, we discovered the motion sensor to be sensitive, with awful night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot. We are confirming with Arlo whether our unit was defective, therefore we may revisit this review.</p>

In spite of that, the alarm needs to suffice to frighten trespassers in most cases. To recoup expenses and hold alarm companies accountable for false alarms, Seattle works straight with your alarm company rather of with you. Your alarm company must be accredited, pay any registration or false alarm fees, and supply physical proof like camera video footage or a damaged window to call for authorities response.</p>
