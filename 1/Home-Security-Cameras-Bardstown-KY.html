It deals with Amazon Alexa, and it provides its own smart door lock, but you can't go setting up lots of third-party gadgets with your SimpliSafe system. It doesn't deal with Z-Wave or IFTTT, and we don't expect it to add extra functionality anytime soon.</p>
<p>DIY installation - With DIY installation, you'll be cutting the additional cost of expert installation.
