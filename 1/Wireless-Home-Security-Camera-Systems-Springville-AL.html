<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, generally referred to as shock sensing units, are different in that they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which travel through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Usually, the most extreme frequencies produced are in between 3 and 5 kHz, depending upon the kind of glass and the presence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn produce an alarm condition.</p>

<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it supplies protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software application to detect it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only a false sense of security given that it avoids only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
