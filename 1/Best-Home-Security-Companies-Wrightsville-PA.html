Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are stored for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month cost (or $80 per year) to save 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limits, we frequently discovered action missing out on, thanks to irregular and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
