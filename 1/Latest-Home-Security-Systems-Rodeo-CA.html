<p>According to a report, homes that do not have a security system are three times more likely to be robbed. Brinks owns and operates its own US-based monitoring center. Its monitoring service includes an advantage called ASAPer, which at the same time messages a group of pre-set contacts to figure out whether alarm activity is a true emergency or incorrect alarm. The majority of monitoring center call household members one at a time, which can slow reaction times.</p>
<p>These rugged smart home devices, designed to endure rain, snow, and severe temperature levels, usually connect to your home Wi-Fi network and permit you to see live video footage of activities happening outside of your house.
