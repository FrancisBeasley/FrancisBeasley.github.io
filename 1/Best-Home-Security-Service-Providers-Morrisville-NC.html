<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your home so we might point them at the same area and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had actually set up on the porch by a certified electrician (who takes place to be my partner). All of the cameras were connected to the very same 2.4 GHz network by means of a Wi-Fi router inside your home (roughly 40 feet from the cameras); service to your home was Verizon Fios.</p>
<p>When using IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do nowadays - you will more than likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can move the large quantity of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at very quick speeds, and typically over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reputable, but not compatible with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, removing the need for additional electrical wiring. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might require less electrical wiring in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera independently, usually through 110VAC power. </p>
