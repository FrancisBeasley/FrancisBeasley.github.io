Surveillance is the act of monitoring something or someone, mostly to prevent or spot criminal activity. With this in mind, video surveillance is the act of observing something with the aid of electronic monitoring and video recording. It generally includes linking camera to an IP network or taping gadget and monitoring the feed.</p>
<p>Indoor security cameras are normally a lot simpler to set up but much less rugged. They're great for placing on your desk but usually they're more of a novelty and less a severe CCTV solution.

Alarm license applications may be conveniently gotten online or from your alarm company. Your alarm company should provide guidelines in obtaining your license.</p>

That isn't to say that you can't have wired home automation, because you can, but automated equipment that is hardwired into your system is slower and harder to secure. It isn't really smart.

<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can identify people the camera is identifying utilizing face recognition. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name.

We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to distinguish expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to determine faces on a close-by TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also provide a broader variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
