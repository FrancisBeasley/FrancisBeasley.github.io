These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range".

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally normal given that the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when customers understand that the economical customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
