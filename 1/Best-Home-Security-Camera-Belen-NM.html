If you plan to match the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially check out the What about Ring? section from our wise video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it comes to video products, we do not think that these concerns alter the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain positive in our existing recommendation.</p>
