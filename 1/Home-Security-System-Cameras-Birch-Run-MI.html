<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in an illuminated space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see at night. If recording video footage in the dark is a top priority, make certain your camera has lots of IR LEDs.</p>
<p>Dome IP camera, as the name recommends, is a type of CCTV camera with a dome cover. However beyond that I simply had issues.
