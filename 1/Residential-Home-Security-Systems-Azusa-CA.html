<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely normal since the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as customers understand that the economical customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's generally too late considering that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
