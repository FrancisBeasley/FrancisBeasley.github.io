<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it provides protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software application to find it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only a false sense of security considering that it prevents only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
