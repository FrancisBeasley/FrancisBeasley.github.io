<p>One of the top home security suppliers since going into the business in 1992, Protect America supplies service for hundreds of countless customers around the United States and Canada. They provide flexibility in their equipment and available plans, allowing homeowners to choose the security option that best fits their requirements. Sadly, there are some drawbacks to Protect America indicated by their low C- ranking from BBB. A majority of the problems center around false information concerning the obligatory 3 year agreement. In fact, many consumers were not aware they were making such a long term dedication. This, combined with the severe penalty for early cancellation-100% of the remaining balance plus paying for all of the equipment-may give some time out in selecting Protect America as their home security solution.</p>
