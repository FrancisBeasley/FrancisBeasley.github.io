<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the very principle of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long way, spanning several decades. The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology gradually evolved into the highly advanced yet affordable systems readily available today. The very first uses of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the methods to tape-record video and view it later. Although video surveillance was monitored out of requirement in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to enhance the result of security systems.</p>
