<p>When using IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will most likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the big amount of data required by digital video and high resolutions at very fast speeds, and often over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trusted, but not compatible with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the requirement for additional circuitry. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might need less electrical wiring in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera individually, generally via 110VAC power. </p>
