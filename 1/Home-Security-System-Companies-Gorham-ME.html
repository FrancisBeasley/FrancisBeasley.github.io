<h3>CCTV Surveillance System in Gorham ME</h3>
<p>On the surface, these two camera classifications may appear comparable, though if you were able to see inside, the distinctions become apparent and unique. Commercial-grade cameras are developed and built for high-performance applications where failure is not a choice; consumer-grade cameras are not. Generally, consumer-grade cameras are built to work well when there is plenty of readily available light, and once the lighting ends up being low or missing (believe sundown or nighttime), their pedigree begins to reveal. Commercial cameras outshine their more affordable cousins since they have larger internal video sensors and higher-quality components that can adjust and capture excellent low light video.</p>

The video recorder need to be acquired individually, and commercial grade recorders start at about $500 (US $) and can vary up to $5000 depending on the quantity of storage, camera connectivity, and image processing features.</p>
