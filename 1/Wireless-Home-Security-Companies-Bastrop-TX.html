<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it offers protection only when the wireless device is "off the air".

In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just a false sense of security because it avoids only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
