<p>One of the first choices that you'll need to make is if you require a wireless or wired security camera system, and the right answer likely depends upon where you intend to place the cameras and components.

<p>I explained that all we would need to do is tap into any one of the emergency call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also included two-way audio, which camera would become the user interface into the VMS system. When a patient presses the emergency situation button, it sends out dual alerts: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Additionally, if the central patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would examine the threat and, if required, might merely press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular flooring.</p>
