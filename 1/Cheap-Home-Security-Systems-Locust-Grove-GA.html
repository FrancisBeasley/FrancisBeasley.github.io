<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it supplies protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software application to discover it.

In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just an incorrect sense of security given that it prevents just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
