And, many membership strategies also include additional functions, such as custom-made motion zones.</p>

<p>Just recently, Ring denied reports that it had suffered a data breach, however we agree with its recommendation that users ought to reset passwords and allow two-factor authentication as a preventive step. All smart-home devices are susceptible to such incidents. However, after this latest entry in a year-long series of controversial media reports, we have chosen to pull our recommendation of Ring's video doorbells. If you prepare to combine the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first read the What about Ring? section from our smart video doorbell guide. While our company believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it pertains to video items, we don't think that these issues change the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay confident in our existing recommendation.</p>
