<p>I explained that all we would require to do is use any one of the emergency call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also consisted of two-way audio, and that camera would become the interface into the VMS system. When a client presses the emergency situation button, it sends out double signals: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. In addition, if the main patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, indicating that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would assess the risk and, if needed, could merely press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific floor.</p>
