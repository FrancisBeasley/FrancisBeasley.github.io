<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you want one? Here is a short description of how thermal cameras work: All things release infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature. The infrared energy released by an object is referred to as its heat signature. In basic, the hotter an object is, the more radiation it discharges. A thermal camera consists of a heat sensing unit that is capable of identifying small differences in temperature level. The gadget gathers the infrared radiation from things in the scene and produces an electronic image based on info about the temperature level distinctions. Since objects are hardly ever precisely the same temperature level as other things around them, a thermal camera can find them, and they will look like unique in a thermal image.</p>

Night vision is included too, for when the lights head out. </p>
